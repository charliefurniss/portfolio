I'm a <a class="index-links" href="/portfolio"><span class="white">web developer</span></a> based in London. My background is in journalism and content marketing, and before that musicology. But I also love <a class="index-links" href="/about"><span class="white">wine, travel and cooking (and eating)</span></a>, as well as playing guitar and violin.


I saw the digital light while project managing a web app at an agency in 2015. Looking over the developer's shoulder reminded me of writing Basic in my childhood. I subsequently gained an <a class="index-links" href="/skills"><span class="white">excellent grounding in full-stack development</span></a> on General Assembly's intensive 12-week programme. 

The more I have learned about this dynamic, creative industry, the more excited I am about working as a developer. I really enjoy solving problems and have found <a class="index-links" href="/portfolio"><span class="white">building apps</span></a> as rewarding as writing magazine features or arranging music.
