I'm a web developer based in London. My background is in journalism and content marketing, and before that musicology. But I also love wine, travel, gardening and cooking, as well as playing guitar and violin.


I saw the digital light while <span class="white">project managing a web app</span> at an agency. Looking over the developer's shoulder reminded me of <span class="white">writing Basic in my childhood</span>. The more I have learned about this dynamic, creative industry, the more excited I have become about working as a developer.
