I'm a web developer based in London. My background is in journalism and content marketing, and before that musicology. But I also love wine, travel and cooking, as well as playing guitar and violin.


I saw the digital light while <span class="white">project managing a web app</span>. Looking over the developer's shoulder reminded me of <span class="white">writing Basic in my childhood</span>. The more I have learned about this dynamic, creative industry, the more excited I am about working as a developer. I particularly enjoy solving problems and find the creative aspect of building apps as rewarding as writing magazine features or arranging music.
