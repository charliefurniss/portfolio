I'm a <a class="index-links" href="/portfolio"><span class="white">web developer</span></a> based in London. My background is in journalism and content marketing, and before that musicology. But I also love <a class="index-links" href="/about"><span class="white">wine, travel and cooking (and eating)</span></a>, as well as playing guitar and violin.

I saw the digital light while project managing a web app in 2015 and got an <a class="index-links" href="/skills"><span class="white">excellent grounding in full-stack development</span></a> on General Assembly's intensive 12-week programme. 

I enjoy solving problems and find <a class="index-links" href="/portfolio"><span class="white">building apps</span></a> extremely rewarding. I’m now eager to broaden my skills and experience – to learn as wide a range of tech as I can and to write ever cleaner, more efficient, more testable code.
