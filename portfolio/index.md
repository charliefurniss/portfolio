I'm a web developer based in London currently. My background is in journalism and before that musicology, but I also love wine, travel, gardening and cooking, as well as playing guitar and violin.


I saw the digital light while <span class="white">project managing a web app</span> for a content marketing agency. Looking over the developer's shoulder reminded me of when <span class="white">I used to write Basic as a child</span>. The more I then learned about this dynamic, creative industry, the more excited I became about working as a developer.
