I'm a web developer based in London looking for my first position as a junior, full-stack dev.


I became interested in development while working as <span class="white">project manager of a web app</span> at a content marketing agency. Looking over the developer's shoulder reminded me of when <span class="white">I used to write Basic as a child</span>. With the encouragement of friends working in tech, I began to consider a career change, and the more I have learned about this dynamic, creative industry, the more excited I have become about working a web developer. 


I've recently completed General Assembly’s 12-week Web Development course, which has given me <span class="white">an excellent grounding in full-stack development</span>. As well as gaining experience in a range of languages and frameworks, I’ve come to understand that <span class="white">process is more important than knowledge</span> per se, and the more I’ve been able to develop and implement my own processes, the more my confidence has grown.
