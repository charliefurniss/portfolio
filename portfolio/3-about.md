In between raising my lovely, lively twin girls, I enjoy wine tasting and try to visit producers in France as often as I can. I love cooking too – <span class="white">roasting, barbecuing, pickling and preserving</span> – and have been collecting recipies from friends and family for a few years now. 

I’ve been lucky enough to have travelled regularly and <span class="white">Spain, Ethiopia and Mexico</span> are among my favourite countries. I also love gardening, although I'm more into mooching around, sniffing flowers and watching things grow than doing anything strenuous.

Music was my first love, so to speak. I played violin while at school and performed regularly as a soloist and in orchestras. I have since focussed more on guitar, playing <span class="white">blues, soul and funk</span> and writing arrangements for various repertoire bands. I've recently started playing violin again inspired by the Kansas City jazzman Claude "Fiddler" Williams.
