I'm a wannabe polymath: I'm passionate about wine, cooking, travel and music, but have no real expertise in any.


<span class="white">I love French, Italian and Spanish wine</span> and try to visit producers for tastings when I can. When it comes to cooking, I’m particularly fond of Mediterranean food, and have been collecting recipies from friends and family for a few years. I’ve been lucky enough to travel regularly, and <span class="white">Spain, Ethiopia and Mexico</span> are among my favourite countries.


Music was my first love, so to speak. I played violin while at school and performed regularly as a soloist and in orchestras. I have since focussed on guitar, playing mostly <span class="white">blues, jazz, soul and funk</span>. I'm also obsessed by Miles Davis and wrote my master’s thesis about his second great quintet.
