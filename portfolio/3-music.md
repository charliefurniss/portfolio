Music was my first love, so to speak. I played violin while at school and performed regularly as a soloist and in orchestras. I have since focussed more on guitar, playing <span class="white">blues, soul and funk</span> and writing arrangements for various repertoire bands. I've recently started playing violin again inspired by the Kansas City jazzman Claude "Fiddler" Williams.
