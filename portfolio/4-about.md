In between raising my lovely, lively twin girls, I enjoy wine tasting and try to visit producers in France as often as I can. I love cooking too – roasting, barbecuing, pickling and preserving – and have been collecting recipies from friends and family for a few years now. I’ve been lucky enough to have travelled regularly and <span class="white">Spain, Ethiopia and Mexico</span> are among my favourite countries. I also love gardening, although I'm more into mooching around, sniffing flowers and watching things grow than doing anything strenuous.
